# waypoint-global-planner
A fork of the [waypoint-global-planner](https://github.com/gkouros/waypoint-global-planner) that can now generate a path using GPS/local waypoints in the form of [geometry_msgs/PoseArray](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseArray.html) without taking into consideration obstacles in the global costmap.
